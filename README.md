# AI
 I took an AI course in third year that had a lovely ongoing assignment scheme of taking the algorithms we saw in theory and implementing them, alongside developing experiments to see the performance of different AI-related techniques. I have quite an affection for the freedoms this provided, and can recall writing a 23-page report for one of them that was particularly juicy. The comments fall off and the files aren't named to the implemented algorithms, so I may revisit this to apply touch-ups and maybe include the reports I wrote for each.
